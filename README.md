A professional portfolio website showcasing my research in Astronautical Engineering, Computational Physics, and Space Systems at the University of Southern California.

**Live Demo:** [https://catch220111.github.io](https://catch220111.github.io)

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains the source code for my personal engineering portfolio. The site is designed as a static Multi-Page Application (MPA) to ensure fast load times, semantic structure, and broad compatibility.

### Key Features
* **Semantic HTML5 Architecture:** Clean, accessible code structure for specialized engineering content.
* **Custom CSS Design:** "Space Blue" & "Deep Space Black" theme designed from scratch (no frameworks) to reflect astronautical aesthetics.
* **LaTeX Integration:** Utilizes **MathJax** to render complex physics equations (e.g., N-Body gravitational forces, Rocket Equation) directly in the browser.
* **Responsive Layout:** Fully adaptive design using Flexbox for mobile and desktop viewing.
